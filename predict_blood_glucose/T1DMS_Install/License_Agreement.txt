	1  BACKGROUND
TEG has certain rights to Software (defined below) for a Computer Simulation Environment for In Silico Testing of Continuous Glucose Monitoring and Optimal Metabolic Control in Diabetes, the “Simulator”, which was developed by Drs. Boris Kovatchev and colleagues at the University of Virginia (“UVA”) and Dr. Adrian Vella at the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“MAYO”). Licensee would like to use the Software for its own internal use to test its own glucose monitoring control algorithms. TEG wishes to grant Licensee a non-exclusive, internal use license to the Software.

	2  DEFINITIONS
2.1   “Enhancements” means any changes to, improvements of, and derivative works of the Software (as derivative works are defined by the U.S. Copyright Laws at 17 U.S.C. §101) made by Licensee.
2.2   “Licensed Field of Use” means internal research activities for the testing of glucose monitoring control algorithms. Without limitation, all uses in human diagnostics or treatment are expressly excluded.  The Software may not be transferred or sublicensed.
2.3   “Software” means the source code and binary files for the training version of the UVa/Padova T1DM Simulator, provided to Licensee pursuant to this Agreement, including all Enhancements as further defined in 2.1 above and 3.3 below.  The training version of the Simulator is designed only for testing of control algorithms and not intended for the collection of data to be submitted to the FDA.  The Software includes the Simulator user's guide and any other material designed for the use in conjunction with the Software, provided to Licensee pursuant to this Agreement.  Both parties agree that any control algorithms developed by Licensee that are not Enhancements shall be owned by Licensee and not considered Software.
