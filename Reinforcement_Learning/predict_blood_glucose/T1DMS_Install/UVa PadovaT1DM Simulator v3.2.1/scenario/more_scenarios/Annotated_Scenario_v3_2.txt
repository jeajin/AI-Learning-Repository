%Tsimul=1440
QTsimul  	Tsimul Units – min*, hour, day
%QTsimul=min
simToD   	Time of Day at start of sim – 0* _in minutes after midnight
%simToD=0

Initial Blood Glucose Value in mg/dl
BGinit NOT SPECIFIED* => subject specific fasting BG _ or Specify in mg/dl 
Such as this example: %BGinit=[100]

MEALS INFO _ Timing, Amount Carbs in total or perkg, Duration of meals
Tmeals	Time of Meals VECTOR in time after start of simulation
%Tmeals=[[8 12 19 23]
QTmeals	Tmeals unit – min*, hour, day
%QTmeals=hour
Meal_Amounts VECTOR matching_Tmeals_CARBS in Total grams or grams perKG BW
%Ameals=[40 60 80 10]
DURATION of meals_Fixed* minutes(15*) or Dmeals VECTOR to match Tmeals
%Dmeals=[15]

%Tclosed=0
%QTclosed=hour

START REGULATION _Time past start of the simulation in minutes
REGULATION => data is included in analysis calcs of results data
Built-in Data Analysis
%Treg=0

OPEN_LOOP Basal injections
basal Fixed _ set "basal=[XX]" – Units of Insulin per minute
Qbasal quest _ quest uses subject-specific basal rate (overrides basal=)
%Qbasal=quest

OPEN_LOOP SQ insulin BOLUS Treatment
OB on will use subject-specific Unit Insulin/g CHO to compute meal bolus
%OB=on
User specified Boluses - OB on set will over ride any Abolus info
Abolus	Vector of bolus amounts in Units of Insulin (total or perkg) 
Tbolus	Time_Vector of bolus injections in QTbolus units
QTbolus	Tbolus Units – min*, hour, day
Qbolus  Units of Bolus: 'total' Units Insulin or 'perkg' U/Kg body weight

OPEN LOOP INSULIN INJECTION INFO – IV  * defaults to zero
TIVINS	Time_Vector - IV insulin injection begin & end times in minutes
QIVins	Dosage Units - IV insulin: 'perkg' b.w. or total 'total'
AIVINS	a vector of IV insulin injection rates (U of insulin per minute)

OPEN LOOP DEXTROSE INJECTION INFO – IV  * defaults to zero
TIVD	Time_Vector of IV dextrose injection begin & end times in minutes
QIVD 	units IVdextrose injection:per kg of weight ('perkg') or ('total')
AIVD 	a vector of IV dextrose injection rates (grams of CHO)
