%>
%> These sample controller model files are provided as a courtesy to the user.
%> 
%> They can be used to assist the user in learning to build a controller.
%> The User is responsible for testing and verifying the use of any of these files.
%> 
%> 
%> the simplest way to replace a controller: 
%>  - always make a saved copy of your model folder before proceeding... 
%>  - open testing_platform.mdl
%>  - click on the orange controller box & DELETE
%>  - in a separate file, click on your new orange controller box & copy
%>  - paste into testing_platform.mdl
%>  - move your new orange controller into place carefully to re-establish connections

%> always check that any new variables introduced in your controller are defined 
%> 
%> (1) in ctrlsetup.m  or
%> 
%> (2) in a file or function called from ctrlsetup.m or the controller
